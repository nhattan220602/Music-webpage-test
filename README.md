Setup

1. Clone or Download the Repository:

Clone the repository using Git:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/music-webpage.git

- Or download the ZIP file from the GitHub repository page and extract it.
2. Ensure File Structure:
- Verify that the images and musics folders are in the same directory as index.html, styles.css, and script.js.

3. Open the Webpage:
- Open index.html in a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) by double-clicking it or dragging it into the browser.

Usage
